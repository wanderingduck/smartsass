<h2>Identify your market</h2>
<p>How well do you know your market?</p>
<p>A deep understanding of your target market is the foundation of writing magnetic content.</p>
<p>I will identify your market, split them into logical, manageable groups and teach you how to write magnetic content.</p>
<h2>Market Personas</h2>
<p>Can you identify your average customer?</p>
<p>Understanding your ideal customer will help you to attract them.</p>
<p>To take your market research to a granular level, we will focus in on the individuals who buy your products or services and learn the problems they need/want to solve.</p>
<h2>Unique Content</h2>
<p>If you already write content, but you aren't getting the traffic, you may be trying to "reinvent the wheel".</p>
<p>These articles may suffer due to high levels of competition.</p>
<p>I will identify niche topics that haven't, yet, been covered and show you techniques to discover priceless content inspiration.</p>
<h2>Quality Content</h2>
<p>Are you producing the best content on the web? You should be!</p>
<p>If you want to market your content, draw traffic and gain authority in your sector, your content needs to be the best on the web.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's fine to cover topics that have already been done as long as you do it better. I will teach you how.</p>
<h2>Dominate Your Niche</h2>
<p>Content marketing will often bring hordes of traffic, but one article per topic won't cut it. You won't keep your visitors interested and you won't gain their trust and respect.</p>
<p>I will show you techniques that will help you dominate content topics and dominate Google's search listings.</p>
<h2>Content Calendar</h2>
<p>You may know what to post, but do you know when?</p>
<p>Posting your articles at the right time makes a huge difference. It's all about knowing what your market wants to read and when.</p>
<p>I will help you to break your topics down and form a content calendar to suit your schedule.</p>
<h2>Content Outreach</h2>
<p>Ever wonder how some websites manage to get huge volumes of traffic, social shares and site interactions?</p>
<p>I will help you to build the perfect outreach strategy to get eyes on your content, links to your pages and traffic on your site.</p>
<h2>Content services</h2>
<p>Need content, but just don't have the time to be writing it?</p>
<p>I can provide you with regular, high quality content that will keep your target market engaged and interacting on your website.</p>
<p>I work with a number of experienced writers who will write, well researched, content on a schedule that suits your budget.</p>
