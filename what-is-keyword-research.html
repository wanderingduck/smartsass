<h2>The principles of keyword research are simple</h2>
<p>The purpose of keyword research is essentially to discover keywords that have a high search volume (the frequency of searches) and low competition (volume and strength of competing pages).</p>
<p>However, due to the vast quantity of websites and competitiveness of high volume keywords/topics, digital marketers will often focus on long-tail keywords and niche topics. These long-tail keywords will usually yield a low level of traffic as less people are using these phrases.</p>
<p class="bold">There are advantages to using long-tail keywords:</p>
<h3>Niche/long-tail keywords are less competitive</h3>
<p>Targeting low competition keywords can still be efficient. They are faster to rank for which means digital marketers can focus on a high volume of these keyword types and still draw a high volume of traffic to the website.</p>
<h3>Traffic from long-tail keywords is often more targeted</h3>
<p>Broad keyword topics often lead to fewer website conversions. Ranking for the term &ldquo;music&rdquo; is virtually impossible as the competition is too strong. However, if your website sells CDs, and ranked on the first page for &ldquo;music&rdquo;, you may receive huge volumes of traffic, but your conversions will be terrible. A more appropriate keyword/phrase would be &ldquo;Buy CDs online&rdquo;. The traffic will be significantly lower but conversions could be much higher.</p>
<h3>Long-tail keywords lead to greater domain authority</h3>
<p>Once your website is ranking for a large number of related niche keywords/topics, the site will have earned trust from search engines. It will, therefore, be easier to rank for more competitive terms.</p>

<h2>Keyword research has changed forever</h2>
<p>In the past, raking for a given keyword/phrase was as easy as stuffing it as many times as you could in your content, titles and meta tags. Unfortunately this lead to abuse and many spam sites rose to the top. Since then search engines have worked hard on their algorithms (the rules they use to rank webpages) and are much better at differentiating between useful and &ldquo;spammy&rdquo; sites.</p>
<h2>Keywords are dead! It&rsquo;s all about topics, themes and relevancy</h2>
<p>Though keyword research is still a vital part of every SEO campaign, search engines (especially Google) are no longer interested in specific keywords. Instead, search engines are increasingly focusing on themes and topics.</p>
<p>The major search engines are now fairly skilful at &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; the theme of a website and the topic of a page. In fact, if your webpage contains the same phrase repeatedly, but doesn&rsquo;t contain relevant synonyms (similar words and phrases). You may be penalised and subsequently drop in rank or worse.</p>
<h2>Why you should avoid using meta keywords</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief most, if not all, search engines don't use the meta keywords to influence search ranking. Why? Because it is easily abused buy spammers. This isn't the only reason you should avoid them: Keyword meta tags make it easy for digital marketers to steal your keyword research. If you put hours or even days into your keyword research, you stand to have all of your research stolen in seconds if you use the keyword meta tag on your site.</p>
<p>Below is a video from Matt Cutts &mdash; the former head of the Google spam team explaining why Google doesn't use the meta keywords tag for ranking in search results:</p>

<h2>Use keywords as targets, but create high-quality content</h2>
<p>Your website isn&rsquo;t just about search rankings. Instead, its main purpose should be to provide a high-quality experience for your users. Keyword research helps digital marketers and website owners to find topics that are &ldquo;un-tapped&rdquo;. This provides the opportunity to develop excellent content that is in high demand.</p>
<p>Though search engines may be more focused on themes and topics than specific keywords, these keywords can still be used to monitor the websites performance in search engines.</p>
