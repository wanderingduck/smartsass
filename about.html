<h2>What is Smart Sprout Digital Marketing?</h2>
<p>Smart Sprout is a one-man digital agency focused on making digital support accessible to all businesses. My time is spent mentoring business owners/marketing teams on best practice and routinely carrying out market research, optimising websites and managing paid campaigns.</p>
<p>I also collaborate with a number of professionals who provide quality work at good value &mdash; such as design &amp; illustration, website development, copy writing and printing (you are welcome to source these services elsewhere if preferred).</p>
<h2>Why is Smart Sprout different?</h2>
<p>Working in digital marketing over the last decade, I have become disheartened witnessing average businesses unable to access professional digital marketing support.</p>
<p>Until now, unless a business had a sizable marketing budget, digital marketing support was out of reach. Smart Sprout is a digital agency that promises to keep marketing costs affordable for everyone.</p>
<h2>How does Smart Sprout keep the prices so low?</h2>
<p>There is no office and no employees. That means no heating, lighting, water and no salaries to pay. Instead, when I feel a business would benefit from other services, I reach out to trusted freelancers who offer great services at reasonable costs and I manage the process, working closely with them to provide a solid and seamless package.</p>
<p>In addition to low overheads, I further reduce costs by mentoring business owners and their teams. This allows me to focus my time on the more complex parts of digital marketing while the business improves its online processes moving forward.</p>
<h2>What practical knowledge will businesses gain?</h2>
<p>I will teach you and your team how to produce magnetic content and together we will build a results driven content marketing strategy and outreach plan. I will demonstrate a variety of on-page and off-page best practice which will place you well ahead of your competitors and in Google's good books.</p>
<p>This includes properly optimising your images, making the website more accessible for those with disabilities, correcting security vulnerabilities to avoid malicious attacks, and preparing each page so it is easily indexed by search engines and usable to visitors. It is essentially your choice how much time you want to put in and how much you want me to manage.</p>
